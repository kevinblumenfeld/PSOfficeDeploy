Drop all the scripts and the Deploy folder into C:\Scripts folder on the SOURCE workstation.
The SOURCE workstation is from where you will "target" other workstations (to install, uninstall and report on Office versions).

Each script needs to be dot sourced.

This will be incorporated into a module soon.
